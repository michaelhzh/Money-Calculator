This is an app that helps my roommate calculate money

future plans:
- Add a login system that is linked to google oauth
- Move the database from Mongodb to a relational database (mysql or postgre)
- Connect with venom (Hopefully)
- Do multiple transactions at the same time (Hopefully)
- Make the UI look better (Maybe)
